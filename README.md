# Connect4
This is a program to implement an agent that plays the Max-Connect4 game using search.
The program will run in two modes: an interactive mode, that is best suited for the program playing against
a human player, and a one-move mode, where the program reads the current state of the game from an input
file, makes a single move, and writes the resulting state to an output file.
